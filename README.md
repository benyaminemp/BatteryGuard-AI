# 🔋 BatteryGuard AI (https://benyaminemp.github.io/BatteryGuard-AI/)

**BatteryGuard AI** is a demo platform that showcases the power of AI in predicting the health and safety of second-life lithium-ion batteries. This project includes a browser-based educational and interactive tool for:

- Understanding Li-ion batteries and battery modelling
- Exploring second-life battery applications
- Uploading data to infer Thevenin equivalent circuit parameters using a trained neural network and PSO algorithm

## 🌐 Live Demo Pages

### 🔹 1. Li-ion Battery & Modelling
Learn why lithium-ion batteries are essential, how battery models work, and the importance of parameterisation using equivalent circuit models.

### 🔹 2. Second-life Batteries
Understand what second-life batteries are, why they're critical for sustainability and energy access, and how we can monitor their health using battery models.

### 🔹 3. Parameter Inference
Upload battery data and use AI to estimate circuit elements such as R₀, R₁, and C₁ of a Thevenin model.


### 🔹 4. Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard for visualisation based on open data.
